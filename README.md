# PokéSpeedTier

A new work-in-progress Pokémon speed calculator. Never get outsped (by surprise) again!
```
# WORK IN PROGRESS

  * Not fully functional yet
   * IV/EV/LEVEL inputs are bugged, yet calculations work fine in console
   * Output doesn't yet change dynammically - only on initial load
   * Tailwind button bugged
  * Not fully styled yet
  * Pokédex not fully implemented (already mapped in Java, need to copypasta)
  * Sprite-sheet not implemented  ( ^^ ditto ^^ )
  * PHP needs to be implemented for dry, modular markup
  
  * Pokémon and modifier selectors functioning
  * Speed calculates correctly (except for above)
